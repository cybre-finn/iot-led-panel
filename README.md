# IoT led panel lamp

I attatched some RGBW LED strips at the back of my LED panel and made everything controllable w/ ESP8266. It still uses normal light switch and boots in full indirect lightning. When I want the bright front panel or a specific color, it's done via HTTP. The main panel is currently not dimmable, because of lack of knowledge about how MOSFETs work.
